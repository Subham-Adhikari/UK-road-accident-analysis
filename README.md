## 📌 **Project Objective**

To analyze road accident data and identify:
- Accident severity distribution  
- Monthly trends across years  
- High-risk vehicle types  
- Impact of weather, road surface, and lighting conditions  
- Rural vs Urban accident patterns  
- Key areas where authorities can improve road safety  

The goal is to provide a **clear, actionable visual summary** for quick decision-making.
