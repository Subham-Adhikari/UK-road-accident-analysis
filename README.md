# 🚗 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

**Dataset:** 2020–2021  
**Records Analyzed:** 300,000+ road accident records  

---

## ⭐ Problem Statement

Road accidents are a critical public safety issue, but raw accident datasets are often **large, messy, and difficult to interpret**. Stakeholders—traffic authorities, urban planners, and safety organizations—struggle to identify **patterns, high-risk factors, and actionable insights** from unstructured data.

**Challenge:** Convert over 3 lakh accident records into a **comprehensive, interactive, and decision-driving dashboard** to help authorities reduce accidents and improve public safety.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build an **interactive Excel dashboard** to:

- Analyze accident severity distribution (Fatal, Serious, Slight)  
- Identify high-risk vehicle types and behaviors  
- Examine environmental and road conditions contributing to accidents  
- Compare Urban vs Rural accident patterns  
- Track Year-over-Year trends and monthly variations  
- Generate actionable insights for decision-makers  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

**Tools & Techniques:** Microsoft Excel, Power Query, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers  

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation

## 💡 Actionable Insights & Recommendations

### 1️⃣ High-Risk Vehicles
- Cars and trucks cause the majority of casualties → **targeted safety campaigns, stricter enforcement, and monitoring**

### 2️⃣ Urban Area Focus
- Urban accidents are more frequent → **improve traffic management, pedestrian zones, and urban road safety policies**

### 3️⃣ Environmental Risks
- Fine weather & dry roads still see high accident numbers → **driver awareness programs focusing on speed and distractions**

### 4️⃣ Infrastructure & Policy Improvements
- Smart traffic monitoring systems in accident-prone areas  
- Better street lighting and road surface maintenance  
- Regular driver training and public awareness campaigns  

### 5️⃣ Data-Driven Decisions
- Maintain a **live accident dataset** to identify **emerging high-risk zones**  
- Use dashboard KPIs to monitor the **impact of interventions**  

> These recommendations not only **reduce accidents**, but also **optimize resource allocation** for traffic authorities, demonstrating the tangible impact of data analysis on public safety.
