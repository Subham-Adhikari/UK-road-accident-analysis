# 🚗 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

## ⭐ Situation
Road accidents were increasing across different regions, but raw data made it difficult to understand the main causes and trends.

## 🎯 Task
Create an interactive Excel dashboard that clearly shows:
- Total casualties
- Severity levels
- Vehicle types involved
- Environmental conditions
- Monthly YoY trends
- Rural vs Urban comparison

## ⚙️ Action
Using **Excel Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, TREEMAP, Doughnut Charts, and YoY analysis**, I built a fully interactive dashboard showing:
- Severity distribution → Fatal, Serious, Slight  
- Vehicle-wise casualties → Cars, Trucks, Bikes, Buses  
- Area-wise comparison → Rural vs Urban  
- Environmental factors → Weather, Road Surface, Light, Wind  
- Year-over-Year monthly trend (2020 vs 2021)

## 📊 Result (Key KPIs)
- **Total Casualties:** 453.1k  
- **Fatal:** 8.3k  
- **Serious:** 66.3k  
- **Slight:** 378.5k  
- **Highest casualties by vehicle:** Cars (355.6k)  
- **Urban accidents:** 274.3k (higher than rural)  
- **Fine weather accidents:** 359.3k (human error more dominant)
